The OECD makes tax wedge numbers available for a few fixed household income situations.
The most appropriate seemed the category of "single person at 167% of average wage".
This is the most expensive category in all cases, so gives the most conservative result we can have

The data was not available by api or scrapable.
For OECD countries, the most recent numbers are from 2019.
For other countries, they are from 2010-2013 as there was only a dated document available.
