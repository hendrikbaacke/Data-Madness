    "Eve is an aspiring young data scientist and soon-to-be DSAI bachelor graduate. As many young professionals, such as also ourselves, Tim, Alain and Hendrik (the authors of this notebook), she is asking herself how much she can earn once she completed her data science degree. Eve is flexible when it comes to where she lives as she was a student until now and if the conditions are right, she would happily move to a given country. \n",

    "#### (1) Data professional salary and living expenditures\n",
    "Eve is especially interested in how the salary for data scientists differs from country to country and how much of that money she can actually keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "As there are also other expenditures that Eve would have to pay for she also asks herself how the picture changes once some of these costs are taken into account.\n",

    "#### (2) The influence of gender on salary in data science and related fields\n",
    "[A lot of talk](https://www.theguardian.com/money/2021/mar/08/young-women-must-work-40-years-longer-than-men-to-plug-100k-pension-gap) these days is about [equal pay for equal work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_pay_gap) independent of personal attributes such as gender, sexual orientation and ethnicity and we write the year [2021](https://medium.com/ill-meet-you-at-the-crossroads/chinese-new-year-2021-year-of-the-metal-ox-1a97b7552176) afterall, so surely [the problem](https://towardsdatascience.com/please-mind-the-gender-pay-gap-9162f13b4202) has been remedied yet? \n",
    "Eve is open-minded and well-educated, also in other areas apart from informatics. She wants to know whether her gender has any effect on the expected salary in the country that she wants to move to. Can she see differences in a country comparison regarding the impact of gender on pay in her industry?\n",
    " \n",
    "#### (3) Should I do a Masters?\n",
    "Finally, Eve asks herself a pressing question that is probably on most of our minds these days (at least if you are an aspiring data science bachelor graduate): \"Should I continue to do a Masters? \n",
    "Putting the joy and other advantages from diving deep(er) and doing research in the context/environment of a higher education organisation aside for a moment, is it worth it from a monetary perspective to pursue a Masters degree in an informatics field (e.g. Data Science, Operations Research)?"

Dividing this over over CPI followed by a multiplication times 100 gives us an indication of our actual purchasing power in a country. We shall distinguish between living in the city centre and living outside of the city centre."

How can we be sure that this finding and what we see is not down to mere chance but that there is an actual statistically significant difference in the amount of expected salary between male and female data scientists? \n",

    "\n",
    "First off, the parameter that we are interested in is the expected salary $\\mu_s$ of a data professional and we can split our population into two samples of male and female data scientists. We can assume that these samples are independent because the salaries of male data scientists are not dependant on the salaries of female data scientists and vice-versa. Hence,<br>\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's test at a significance level of $\\alpha = 1\\%$. The underlying samples have relatively large sample sizes with $n_F = 4270$ and $n_M = 26955$, therefore we perform a two-sample $z$-test. We thus assume that we have enough data points to get a very good estimate of the true mean and standard deviation of the 'complete' populations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can assume sample independence, the same does not hold for the standard deviation. It can be seen from above boxplot that $\\sigma$ is different for the male and female population.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we perform a two-sample two-sided $z$-test in order to find whether the defined $H_0$ can be rejected or not. In order to compare the two means from distributions with different $\\sigma$, we make use of statsmodel's `CompareMeans.ztest_ind` function."

    "**Observation:** Interestingly, even though in the statsmodels documentation it is specified that `CompareMeans.ztest_ind` performs a $z$-test, apparently the sample standard deviation is taken into account for the computation. This has been spotted when using above specified \"[manually implemented](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/124096/two-samples-z-test-in-python)\" function and parsing either `stdev`(sample std) or `.std()`(population std). Either way, the found values for $z$-statistic and corresponding the $p$-value do not differ much ($-7.799$ with `stdev` vs.$-7.8$ with `.std()`."
